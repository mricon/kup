2017-03-14 Konstantin Ryabitsev <mricon@kernel.org> - 0.3.5
	* Add support for "subcmd" option for kup client, for cases where
	  kup is used with another authZ system relying on ssh (specifically,
	  gitolite).
	* Small typo fixes
2012-12-10 Konstantin Ryabitsev <mricon@kernel.org> - 0.3.4
	* Calculate and log sha256sums of all uploaded files for forensic
	  record-keeping.
	* Remove magic-guessing logic from kup client, as it was interfering with
	  people's ability to upload gzipped kernel images. We're now being dumb
	  about it -- we only rely on the extension to guess whether the server
	  needs to uncompress the contents before verifying sig.

2012-02-13 Konstantin Ryabitsev <mricon@kernel.org> - 0.3.3
	* Allow specifying the key to use for gpg-sign-all.
	* Remove kup.kernel.org as the default host setting.
	* Show 1 decimal when reporting progress in kup-server.
	* Manpage fixes and expansions.
	* Make mkdir recursive.
	* Allow specifying compressors in kup-server.cfg.

2011-11-29 Konstantin Ryabitsev <mricon@kernel.org> - 0.3.2
	* Give feedback during compression stage on the server, as that is 
	  likely to take a long time for large tarballs (patch by hpa).

2011-11-24 Konstantin Ryabitsev <mricon@kernel.org>
	
	* Allow slashes "/" in KUP_RSH and .kuprc/rsh setting, so it is possible
	  to pass -i to the ssh command.
	* Add kup-server.1 manpage.
	* Add ChangeLog.
	* Rewrite README to be more abouty.
