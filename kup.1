.TH KUP "1" "2011" "kernel.org upload utility" "kernel.org"
.SH NAME
kup \- kernel.org upload utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkup\fP [\fIglobal options\fP] \fIcommand\fP [\fB\-\-\fP \fIcommand...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This utility is used to upload files to \fIkernel.org\fP and other
systems using the same upload system (\fBkup-server\fP).  Each upload
is required to have a PGP signature, and the server will generate
multiple compressed formats if the content uploaded is intended to be
compressed.
.PP
Additionally, if the user has content from a
.BR git (1)
tree already on server, it is possible to reproduce the content
server-side and therefore reducing bandwidth needs.  The user still
has to generate the content locally and sign it.
.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-batch\fP
Instead of connecting to a remote host, output the protocol content to
standard output.  The output from an arbitrary number of
.B kup
invocation can be concatenated and then sent to the server as a single
session.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-rsh, \fB\-\-ssh\fP \fIcommand\fP
Override the default command used to connect to the server.  The
default is set by the environment variable
.B KUP_RSH
or if that is not set,
\fIssh \-a \-x \-k \-T\fP.
.TP
\fB\-H\fP, \fB\-\-host\fP \fI[user@]host\fP
Override the default user and host to which to connect.  The default
is set by the environment variable
.B KUP_HOST
or if that is not set,
\fIupload.kernel.org\fP.
.SH COMMANDS
A series of commands can be specified on a single command line,
separated by a double dash argument (\fB\-\-\fP).
.PP
In all cases, PGP signatures are detached signature files
corresponding to the \fIuncompressed\fP content.  If a
\fIremote_path\fP ends in \fP\.gz\fP then
.BR gzip ,
.B bzip2
and
.B xz
compressed files are generated on the server; otherwise the content is
stored uncompressed.
.TP
\fBput\fP \fIlocal_file\fP \fPsignature_file\fP \fIremote_path\fP
Upload the file \fIlocal_file\fP with signed with
\fIsignature_file\fP.  \fIlocal_file\fP can be compressed with
.BR gzip ,
.B bzip2
or
.BR xz ;
this may reduce upload time.  The content will be stored compressed or
uncompressed depending solely on the extension of \fIremote_path\fP.
.TP
\fBput\fP \fB\-\-tar\fP \fIremote_tree\fP \fIref\fP \fPsignature_file\fP \fIremote_path\fP
Generate a tar archive file from ref \fIref\fP of git tree
\fIremote_tree\fP (using \fBgit archive \-\-format=tar\fP) with
signature \fIsignature_file\fP generated locally, and place it in
\fIremote_path\fP.
.sp
\fBgit archive\fP has been found to be relatively stable, and so this
command is relatively robust to git version changes.
.TP
\fBput\fP \fB\-\-diff\fP \fIremote_tree\fP \fIref1\fP \fIref2\fP \fPsignature_file\fP \fIremote_path\fP
Generate a patch file between refs \fIref1\fP and \fIref2\fP of git
tree \fIremote_tree\fP (using \fBgit diff-tree \-p\fP) with signature
\fIsignature_file\fP generated locally, and place it in
\fIremote_path\fP.
.sp
The output of \fBgit diff-tree\fP has been found to vary between
.B git
versions, and so successful use of this command may require the same
version of
.B git
locally as on the server in order to produce a valid signature.
.TP
\fBmkdir\fP \fIremote_path\fP
Create a new directory on the server.
.TP
\fBmv|move\fP \fIold_path\fP \fInew_path\fP
Move the file or directory \fIold_path\fP to \fInew_path\fP.  For a
file, the \fI.sign\fP files are also moved, and for compressed files,
all the compression formats are moved together.
.TP
\fBln|link\fP \fIold_path\fP \fInew_path\fP
Hard link the file or directory \fIold_path\fP to \fInew_path\fP.  For a
file, the \fI.sign\fP files are also linked, and for compressed files,
all the compression formats are linked together.
.TP
\fBrm|del|delete\fP \fIold_path\fP
Delete the file or directory \fIold_path\fP.  For a file, the
\fI.sign\fP files are also deleted, and for compressed files, all the
compression formats are deleted together.
.TP
\fBls|dir\fP \fIpath...\fP
Lists back the contents of one or more directories on the server.
