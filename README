INSTALLING
----------

No particular installation is necessary. However Kup has a few dependencies
and will fail to start if they are not installed. Most distros have them
already packaged. In the rare event that your distro would not provide
them, then your distro likely has the "cpan" tool to install them :

  $ sudo cpan install Config::Simple Encode File::Spec

SUPPORT
-------
Kup is on github: https://github.com/mricon/kup
